This project comprises all the code needed to run a website that can use location services to find a water resource near you. It was designed to work in the Dominican Republic, and it was a part of my group’s submission for the AIS (Association for Information Systems) Software Innovation Challenge 2023. My group decided to develop a solution geared towards a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which was Clean Water and Sanitation. This project/website would help in providing access to clean water.

To run the backend code, you need to have Visual Studio Code installed. Inside of Visual Studio Code, you need to have python, django and django cors headers installed. In order to start this backend server, open the terminal and run the command ‘python manage.py runserver’. It should now be available for the frontend aspect of our website to connect to, and retrieve/post data in order to carry out its operations. Multiple Online resources such as Stack Overflow and ChatGPT were used to assist in the creation of this project’s code.
